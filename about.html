        <p>
            My name is Robert Chambers I go by Andy. I have been into computers since I was young.<br>
            I worked with HTML in high school. It was pretty neat to be able to do it in high school.<br>
            I served in the Navy for 7 1/2 years active duty. Completed 4 Deployments in 5 years while<br>
            serving onboard the USS Wasp LHD-1. Rest of my military time was spent working on an airfield<br>
            in Virginia Beach, Va. Before exiting the miltary I started school with ITT Tech in Norfolk <br>
            and I completed it in March 2013 with an Associates of Applied Sciene for<br>
            Computer Networking Systems. I started school again in October 2022 at California Institute of <br>
            Arts & Technology for software development. I really enjoy a good project and challenge. I believe<br>
            I can excel in this field.
